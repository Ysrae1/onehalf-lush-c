# MyCustomOneHalfLush

`MyCustomOneHalfLush` is a customized version of [CodeGradox's onehalf-lush](https://github.com/CodeGradox/onehalf-lush). This version has been optimized in terms of colors and styles based on personal preferences. The main modification is the adjustment of the cyan color used as the background color for LspReference in both light and dark modes, which enhances readability.

## Acknowledgements

This color scheme is a modification based on `onehalf-lush` originally developed by `CodeGradox`. I extend my gratitude to [CodeGradox](https://github.com/CodeGradox) for their excellent contribution to the community.
